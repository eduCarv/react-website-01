# bit Bank
This is a website created with ReactJs by following the Brain Design on youtube. It introduces the scroll link, that is when you click on a link and this is an anchor to a section on that page instead of go there like magic, it scrolls.

It shows how to create a Data.js to ensure more flexibility in the stylizing section.

You can see the final project here: http://bit.ly/bitbankapp
